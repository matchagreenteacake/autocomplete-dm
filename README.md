# atom-autocomplete-dm

## Introduction

A very simple, work in progress autocomplete package meant for the Dream Maker language. This will only contains proc and definition that's used in DM only - Not including those used in SS13. That'll be covered separately.

Based on https://github.com/lonekorean/atom-autocomplete-boilerplate
